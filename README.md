# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of my hands-on machine learning projects. Each project is organized in its own folder with well-documented notebooks and datasets. The goal is to explore different algorithms, improve data preprocessing techniques, and build models that can solve real-world problems.
